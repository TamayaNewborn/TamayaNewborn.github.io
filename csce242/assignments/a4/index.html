                                    <p> For my first assignment I decided to go into the New Year wiith a final
                                         wrap up of 2019. With some of my favorite things being fashion, music,
                                        and tv, I thought why not revisit some of those most popular trends of
                                         2019 and see what really had the biggest impact on people throughout 
                                         the entire year.

                                            <p> I personally find learning about astrology to be very interesting. So,
                                                for this weeks assignement I thought it would be interesting to use the new
                                                techniques I was learning to add pictures and centering them properly to make 
                                                a webpage centered all around astrology.

                                            <p> This week we learned a lot about flexing and learning new ways to readjust the 
                                                way things are positioned on the page and make the page look cleaner. To test our 
                                                abilities we were tasked with replicating a webpage using things like flex, padding, 
                                                classes and id's to help get the task done.  </p>
